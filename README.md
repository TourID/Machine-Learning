## Overview
In this project, the ML teams implemented algorithms for tourism place recommendations using Neural Collaborative Filtering. The steps we followed included collecting, cleaning, and balancing a public dataset from Kaggle. We then split the data into training, validation, and testing sets. Using Neural Collaborative Filtering, we built the model architecture, set up callbacks to stop training at the desired loss, and achieved a loss and MSE below 0.2. Finally, we applied our model using Keras for implementation.

## Feature
Our recommendation system uses the architecture of the Neural Collaborative Filtering model. Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) is a modern approach in recommendation systems that uses artificial neural networks to predict user preferences for items. This approach combines traditional collaborative filtering techniques with the power of neural networks to improve recommendation accuracy. The model also implements K-Fold Cross-Validation to ensure the model works well on various subsets of data.

## Dataset
The public dataset we used can be found here (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aprabowo/indonesia-tourism-destination). In addition, we also added a new dataset that includes new users and new ratings to explore tourist destinations based on the place IDs that have ratings from the top 20 user IDs.
