## Overview
In this project, the ML teams implemented algorithms for tourism place recommendations using Neural Collaborative Filtering. The steps we followed included collecting, cleaning, and balancing a public dataset from Kaggle. We then split the data into training, validation, and testing sets. Using Neural Collaborative Filtering, we built the model architecture, set up callbacks to stop training at the desired loss, and achieved a loss and MSE below 0.2. Finally, we applied our model using Keras for implementation.
